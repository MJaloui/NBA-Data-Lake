## **Project Highlights**
⛹🏾‍♀️ This repository contains the setup_nba_data_lake.py script, which automates the creation of a data lake for NBA analytics using AWS 
    services. 

⛹🏾‍♀️ The script integrates Amazon S3, AWS Glue, and Amazon Athena

⛹🏾‍♀️ It also sets up the infrastructure needed to store and query NBA-related data.



## **Capabilities**
**The setup_nba_data_lake.py script performs the following actions:**

🔧 Creates an Amazon S3 bucket to store raw and processed data.

🔧 Uploads sample NBA data (JSON format) to the S3 bucket.

🔧 Creates an AWS Glue database and an external table for querying the data.

🔧 Configures Amazon Athena for querying data stored in the S3 bucket.



## **Technologies**
⚙️ **Cloud Provider**: AWS

⚙️ **Core Services**: S3, Glue, Athena

⚙️ **Command-Line Tool**: AWS CloudShell

⚙️ **Programming Language**: Python 3.x

⚙️ **Infrastructure as Code**: Python script for automating AWS resource creation

⚙️ **External API**: SportsData.io NBA API

⚙️ **Environment Management**: Environment variables for secure API key storage

⚙️ **IAM Security**: Least privilege policies for S3, Glue, and Athena

⚙️ **Data Querying**: Amazon Athena

⚙️ **Data Storage**: Amazon S3 (raw and processed data)

⚙️ **Data Cataloging**: AWS Glue

# Prerequisites

1. Go to Sportsdata.io and create a free account

2. IAM Role/Permissions: Ensure the user or role running the script has the following permissions:

3. S3: s3:CreateBucket, s3:PutObject, s3:DeleteBucket, s3:ListBucket
  Glue: glue:CreateDatabase, glue:CreateTable, glue:DeleteDatabase, glue:DeleteTable
  Athena: athena:StartQueryExecution, athena:GetQueryResults


## **Setup Instuctions** 

Step 1: Log into AWS and Open CloudShell Console

step 2: Create the setup_nba_data_lake.py file

Step 3: In another window, go to [GitHub](https://github.com/MJaloui/NBADataLake) and copy the contents inside the setup_nba_data_lake.py file located in the SRC file to paste in the file
        you created in the cloudshell console.

Step 4: Configure API key in the Python script.

Step 5: Create .env file to create variables that store your API Key and NBA endpoint for your scripts.

Step 6: Run the script

Step 7: Manually Check For The Resources, validate the data is there.

step 8: Head over to Amazon Athena to try a query.
